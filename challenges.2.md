# Kubernetes 101 Challenge

For scheduling applications consisting of multiple containers you typically use an orchestrator. Kubernetes is an orchestrator and in this chapter you will set up a Kubernetes cluster in Azure Container Services (ACS) and an Azure Container Registry (ACR) to store your images.

## Here's what you'll learn

- How to set up a Kubernetes Cluster with Azure Container Services
- How to access the cluster with the commandline command "kubectl"
- Get to know the basic command set of "kubectl"
- Understand the concept of pods and services and how they come together
- Get in touch with Yaml files to specify a desired state for a Kubernetes object


## 1. Create a Kubernetes cluster on Azure Container Services 

> Need help? Check hints [here :blue_book:](hints/createk8scluster.md)!
- Set up your Kuberenetes cluster using Azure Container Services.

The deployment will take some time (~ up to 20 min).

## 2. Run single container app in your K8s cluster

> Need help? Check hints [here :blue_book:](hints/k8sSingle.md)!
- Run a public available application in a single container on your cluster. The image name is "nginx".
  - Use the `kubectl run` command
- Add a service to make your application accessible from the internet
  - Use the `kubectl expose` command and `kubectl edit YOURSERVICE` command.
- Start your webbrowser to view your application running in your cluster.

## 3. Kubernetes discovery

- Open the K8s portal for a graphical interface. Run `kubectl proxy` then open up a browser an navigate to <http://localhost:8001/ui> or <http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard/proxy/#!/pod?namespace=default>(might require additional ssh tunneling)
- If you want to work with namespaces. Create your own namespace `foo` with

```sh
kubectl create ns foo
```

and apply this postfix to your `kubectl` commands like

```sh
kubectl get pods -n foo
```

- Familiarize yourself with the following commands on commandline, eg.

```sh
kubectl get pods                # to display all pods
kubectl get svc                 # to display all services
kubectl get deployments         # to display all deployments
kubectl delete pods/<podid>     # to delete a specific pod
```

## 4. Execute deployments via yaml

> Need help? Check hints [here :blue_book:](hints/yamlfiles.md)!

- Launch the nginx deployment via yaml file (see if you can download it somewhere?)
- Launch a custom image from your registry (learn about secrets or registry authentication)
- You can declare a namespace inside your yaml file
