## 0. Create Resources
In this challenge you will set up all it takes to complete this hackathon.
Here's a list of things we need to set up:

- A *Resource Group* - this will be the place where you will put all Azure resources. Use a naming scheme like labuserXX_rg when working in a shared subscription. Always use a single Azure region. If nothing else is stated by the instructor, use "WestEurope". 
- Create a *Azure Container Registry* in the Resource Group - here we are going to store our Docker container images.
